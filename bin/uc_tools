# This is a trampoline binary.  Some context:
#
# uc_tools is intended to be an ad hoc collection of tools I [Tom] use
# for bare metal embedded development.  Typically this code is
# included in other projects as a git submodule.
#
# Recently some need has arisen to expose some of the functionality as
# stand alone executables.  To avoid clutter, a single trampoline
# script is used.  This way the verbose names can be kept.
#
# This is currently only in active use together with Nix.
