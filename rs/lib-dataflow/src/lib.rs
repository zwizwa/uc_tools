// Note: because Lua wrappers for the internal types need to be
// defined in the crate where the types are defined (to avoid
// wrappers), the types are defined in the Lua module.  This is ok
// because the whole point of the exercies is to keep Lua in the mix,
// i.e. replace a Lua implementation with a Rust core implementation.
