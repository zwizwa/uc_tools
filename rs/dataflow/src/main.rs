How to tackle this?

Ideas:
- Focus on data representation: Lua and Rust data structures should be equivalent
- Gradually replace functions and data structures with Rust code

Notes:
- https://crates.io/crates/mlua

Questions:
- How to expose as a Lua library?
- How to map Lua data structures to Rust data structures?
