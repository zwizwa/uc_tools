Grab bag of tools for real-time microcontroller applications. 

This code supports development of naked state machines running on bare
metal (no RTOS) without dyamic memory allocation.  I.e. malloc is not
linked into the target binary. It contains:

- sm.h : A macro langauge for writing composable sequential state
  machines.  Think "tasks with static stack frames".

- A monitor application based on GDB RSP (GDBSTUB) to provide
  incremental development.  Think "C REPL on a micocontroller".

- Misc support code for the above.

Basically, this is a stripped down version of the ideas behind Staapl,
but using C instead of Forth.
