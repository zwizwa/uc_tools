/* SM: Composable State Machines in C. */



/* RATIONALE:

   Most state machines encountered "in the wild" in embedded software
   systems are linear sequences of code, possibly with some form of
   early abort in case of errors.

   In the presence of an RTOS, these would be most conveniently
   expressed as blocking tasks, possibly with nested subroutines.

   However, when an RTOS is not available or appropriate, the
   abstraction in this file can lift some of the nuisance associated
   with implementing state machines manually (E.g. using explicit
   switch statements and/or function pointers).

   It implements abstractions for:

   - Waiting on a condition to be satisfied (SM_WAIT).

   - Code reuse for re-occuring subtasks (SM_CALL).


   The abstractions allow operation both from a main event loop
   polling routine calling a main _tick() method, and a ISR, e.g. to
   _tick() only when an event is there.

   A note on SM_CALL: Instead of using a call stack (as is done in the
   RTOS task case), the caller of a subroutine (submachine) manages
   its callee state explicitly as a constituent of its own state.

*/


/* IMPLEMENTATION:

   The implementation uses some GCC extensions:

   - computed goto / GCC labels as values.
     https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html

   - the __COUNTER__ macro to implement GENSYM.
     https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html

   - statement expressions:
     https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html

   At the expense of convenience, it is possible to use switch()
   statements and manual label generation to translate this to
   portable code.



   A state machine consists of:

   - a struct with a "next" member to contain the C code resume point
   - a _init() method to initialize the struct
   - a _tick() method to perform the next action, containing
   - a "halt" label (pointing to SM_HALT) if SM_WAIT_TICK is used

   These _tick() methods have a body that looks like:

   {
     SM_RESUME(sm);
     // ... C code with SM_WAIT(sm, ...) statements
   halt:
     SM_HALT(sm);
   }

   SM_RESUME() enters the state machine, executing the following C
   code statement if the machine was resently initialized, or resuming
   where it left off in a previous call to _tick().

   An SM_WAIT() statement will evaluate a condition and if it is
   false, it will exit the _tick() method after puttimg the machine in
   a state such that the condition is re-evaluated the next time
   _tick() is executed.  In this case _tick() returns SM_WAITING.

   SM_HALT() loops forever in halting state, signalling this condition
   by the SM_HALTED return value.


   Caveat: Take specoal care in using local/automatic variables inside
   a _tick() function.  These are only valid inbetween suspension
   points.  However, GCC should produce warnings of uninitialized
   variables.
