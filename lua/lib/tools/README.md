Small tools for lists, tables, files.  Basic lispy things that are
missing in Lua standard library.

These are plucked from another project.  Currently the files need to
be duplicated until a code organization problem is solved in the other
project.  I am copying only the functions that are needed for uc_tools
scripts for now.
