/* Revisiting Forth

   - A "protocol oriented" language (e.g. design protocol to keep
     parser simple).

   - A simple way to allow for state machines to be implemented as
     processes

   - Avoid the dual-language problem by using the same ABI in C and
     Forth, at least for 0-op functions.  This should avoid the dual
     language issue.  I.e. it will be trival to convert (textual)
     Forth to (textual) C.

   - Start out interactively.  E.g. before doing anything, a Forth is
     running on the console.

   - Use a "standard" Forth approach.  Maybe start from eforth?
