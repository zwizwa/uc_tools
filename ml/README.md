Re-evaluating OCaml as a glue language.

Some bullet points:

- Lightweight and fast
- Type system is "good enough"
- Runs wide, including compilation to JavaScript, and Erlang
- Haskell is ridiculously bloated
- I got interested in contributing to Caramel to re-learn
- Expect tests

TODO:

- Evaluate C interface.
- Evaluate final tagless for model->C compilation
